## About this fork

I really liked this theme, so I decided to tweak it for this business. Feel free to fork it, and give credit to the author.

[Freelancer](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/) is a one page freelancer portfolio theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). This theme features several content sections, a responsive portfolio grid with hover effects, full page portfolio item modals, and a working PHP contact form.
